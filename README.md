## What is Surge?
Surge is an experiment in fast-hashing blocks combined with the Kimoto Gravity Well technology. 
Using the same reward and block parameters as Dogecoin, we've increased the block find and retarget 
rates to reach a quicker end-of-life cycle while preventing large multipool abuse with KGW difficulty recalculating.
